<p>
Javascript is partially run and somewhat indexed by modern crawlers. This is still not the same as various other elements such as h1 or a tags.
</p>
<p>
The various element source urls are seen by crawler bots, but all that really does is tell the bot the content is elsewhere. Thus this project just acknowledges that a frame or embed was there.
