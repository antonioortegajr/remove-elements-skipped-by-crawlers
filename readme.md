The purpose of this project is to create a visual representation of what crawler bots "see" when they visit to index a web site. Imagine you and  robot visted the same page. The aim of this project is to let you borrow the robot eyes to see the same page.

More accurately what robot eyes don't see.

Elements such as iframe, frameset, object, and embed have the content they contain not "seen" by crawlers in the same was as other elements on a web page. While

This idea of this visual representation was to add the "blindness" crawlers have to certain elements on a webpage. These elements like iframes are perfectly visible to humans, but crawler bots really are only seeing a tag and a source url.

Javascript is partially run and somewhat indexed by modern crawlers. This is still not the same as various other elements such as <h1> or <a> tags.

The various element source urls are seen by crawler bots, but all that really does is tell the bot the content is elsewhere. Thus this project just acknowledges that a frame or embed was there.
